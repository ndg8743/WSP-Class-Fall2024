Hi, I'm Nathan, a senior Computer Science student at SUNY New Paltz, set to graduate this December. I have a strong academic foundation in programming, having completed some projects, most recently a multithreaded Fibonacci compute engine last semester with my team for the Software Engineering course here at New Paltz. My passion for technology also extends into hardware; I’ve built my own PC and frequently upgrade laptops and other hardware. This summer salvaging parts from a friend's computer with a bad motherboard and upgrading it (48gb RAM, a workstation CPU, etc), and I enjoy upgrading laptops and other computers whenever I can, or just fixing what broken I guess. The ability to blend my interests in both software and hardware is something I hope to be able to do in the future.
My programming experience covers languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript. The most recent project, Fibonacci Fractal Engine, used Java and Vue.js. Additionally, I developed a cloud-based To-Do List manager using TypeScript, JavaScript and Python and ran it using AWS (AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Docker, and Next.js) which helped me gain experience in serverless architectures and full-stack development (still in progress).
I see this Web Programming course as an opportunity to strengthen my skills in front-end and back-end web development, particularly with tools like Vue, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I’m excited to apply what I learn to real-world projects and get experience that will be more useful for expanding my career opportunities.
